# Southeastern Conference-Digital Humanities/Scholarship (SEC-DHS)
## Our origin story

This group arose from a meeting between the Digital Scholarship and Digital Humanities Librarians at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, and the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. Realizing that we are all facing similar issues at our institutions, we have started a working group to collaborate on finding solutions to our common conundrums.

## Guiding Ethos

This space will remain a safe and open forum to discuss issues that arise in our digital humanities/digital scholarship support units. 

### Safety

Your use of this space constitutes your agreement to follow these community guidelines. 

- Treat others online as you would treat them in real life.
- Be tolerant towards other's viewpoints; respectfully disagree when opinions do not align.
- Respect the privacy and personal information of other users.
- Communicate with courtesy and respect.


### Openness

We believe that open discussion and collaboration should exist within academia to better serve the mission of higher learning. In many cases, the workflows and solutions used to support digital projects are not sensitive information, and collaboration with peers who face similar problems serves only to help all parties involved. That said, we invite you to adopt the idea "as open as possible; as closed as necessary" to guide your participation in this group. Post at your own discretion, keeping in mind that the words you share should always promote an ethic of care as it relates to our work.

## How to use this space

We will use Projects, Issues, and Wikis to communicate the problems we encounter, the resources we find to address them, the solutions we attempt, and the  running documentation we create to facilitate stable onboarding and transitions for future collaborators at our respective institutions and beyond. We describe the appropriate use of each of these functions below.

### Issues
- Create issues to identify a discrete problem within a broader project. For example, you might create an issue called "Project Intake" that describes the problem of creating a way for faculty, staff, and students to propose a project or request a consultation. 

### Projects
Project boards categorize issues so that users can easily see 
- **resources/readings** related to a broadly defined problem
- solutions users are **attempting** at their institutions
- solutions users decide to **adopt**
- and solutions users decide to **abandon**

### Wikis
Document as much or as little of your institution's current digital project processes as you find appropriate. This space may be useful to individual institutions as a way to onboard or transition roles within your digital humanities/digital scholarship support units. It will also help Digital Humanities/Digital Scholarship Librarians at other institutions easily find examples of current strategies used by peer institutions.
