# Southeastern Conference-Digital Humanities/Scholarship (SEC-DHS)
## Our origin story

This group arose from a meeting between the Digital Scholarship and Digital Humanities Librarians at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, and the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. Realizing that we are all facing similar issues at our institutions, we have started a working group to collaborate on finding solutions to our common conundrums.
